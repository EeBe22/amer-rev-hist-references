# References for Mix Family Research

Active reference list for my historical research into the Mix families of New Haven, CT during the American Revolution.
I may add more families of interest to this repository, as their paths cross the Mix family.

I'm currently researching my distant ancestor's participation in the American Revolution, as well as several of his family menbers. 
As part of this project, I'm keeping track of all the resources I've used in collecting this information, with links provided when available. 
Knowing that links will break, and already in this year (2025) I've seen formerly reliable websites like military or government sites altered to remove information, I want to make sure the information I'm using is recorded to the best of my ability.
